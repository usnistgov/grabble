# Grabble is for Graphs
A Tidier, Analysis-first Data Format for Networks

## Description
Using the principles of tidy data, this project aims to provide quality-of-life improvements for analysis handling graph data in Python.
Grabble eases transitions among various ways of representing graph structures.

Key principles:
- Levi graph structures serve as pivot format
- Nodes and Edges are interchangeable entities, depending on analystâ€™s intent
- Define key graph features, such as directedness and weights, without having to rely on metadata

## Who are we?

This toolkit is a part of the Knowledge Extraction and Application for Smart Manufacturing (KEA) project, within the [Systems Integration Division](https://www.nist.gov/el/systems-integration-division-73400/information-modeling-and-testing-group) at NIST.

### Why "KEA"? 

The KEA project seeks to better frame data collection and transformation systems within smart manufacturing as collaborations between human experts and the machines they partner with, to more efficiently utilize the digital and human resources available to manufacturers. Kea (nestor notabilis) on the other hand, are the world's only alpine parrots, finding their home on the southern Island of NZ. Known for their intelligence and ability to solve puzzles through the use of tools, they will often work together to reach their goals, which is especially important in their harsh, mountainous habitat.
