# Grabble
Enables organized and flexible network analysis

## Description
Using the principles of tidy data, this project aims to provide quality-of-life improvements for analysis handling graph data in Python.
Grabble eases transitions among various ways of representing graph structures.

Key principles:
- Levi graph structures serve as pivot format
- Nodes and Edges are interchangeable entities, depending on analystâ€™s intent
- Define key graph features, such as directedness and weights, without having to rely on metadata
